## Prisma Schema Changes and Migrations

When making changes to `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`:

1. **Always create a migration** after schema changes:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npx prisma migrate dev --create-only --name descriptive_migration_name
   ```

2. **Review the migration SQL** in `backend/prisma/migrations/[timestamp]_[name]/migration.sql` before applying

3. **Apply migration locally**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run prisma:migrate
   # or
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

4. **For production deployments**:
   - Migrations are applied using `prisma migrate deploy` (not `migrate dev`)
   - The production migration command is: `npm run prisma:migrate:deploy` in the backend directory
   - This applies pending migrations without creating new ones

5. **After schema changes**:
   - Prisma Client is automatically regenerated during `npm run build`
   - If needed manually: `npm run prisma:generate`

6. **Migration workflow**:
   - Development: `prisma migrate dev` (creates and applies migration)
   - Production: `prisma migrate deploy` (only applies existing migrations)
   - Never use `prisma db push` in production - it doesn't track migrations

## Important Notes

- Schema changes require migrations - don't skip this step
- Always test migrations locally before deploying
- Check migration status: `npx prisma migrate status`
- Migrations are tracked in `backend/prisma/migrations/`
